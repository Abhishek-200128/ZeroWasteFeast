      title: "Pick 'ugly' fruit and vegetables",
      description:
        "Choose from the 'odd bunch' or the 'reject fruit and veg' area at your local shop. These odd-shaped fruit and veg are just as healthy and tasty, and once chopped or grated, you can’t tell the difference! Freeze your black bananas for smoothies (take the skin off first!), and stew your soft apples with cinnamon to make a delicious apple sauce.",

    {
      title: "Store food wisely",
      description:
        "Rotate the food in your fridge, freezer and pantry so the older items are at the front and are used first. Have a look at the 'use-by date' and 'best before date' as the latter is still safe to eat after the suggested date. Cook or freeze those that are close to the use-by date.",

      title: "Eat Smart",
      description:
        "Dish out smaller portions at home or choose entrée size at the restaurant. Freeze left-overs or have them for lunch the day after. Ask for a 'doggy' bag to take left overs home after eating out to eat the next day.",

        "By buying local produce, you support family farmers and small businesses in your community. You also help fight pollution by reducing food miles.",
